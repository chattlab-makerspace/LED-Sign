# LED Sign Board Revamp Project
This project aims to make the LED Sign Board a more valuable prototyping platform for learning usage of "neopixel" style LEDs
It does this by developing the interface with the individual LED strips to enable easier wiring while also providing fusing for lengths of 64 LEDS
Additionally it allows the 144/m strips to be spaced such that every two neopixels will make for one square pixel, which is satisfying despite halving the resolution when used.
